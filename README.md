## Selected project: Plane 

Nathan - Gui and refactoring to work with backend

Cory - backend

The plane will have *30* rows with each row containing *3* seats on each side.
Each person has a suitcase that will take a random amount of time to put away before allowing the person directly behind to move
People will reach their row and then take time storing luggage, afterwards they move to their seat

### Scenario 1
Group section with be for 5 rows for 6 sections, with the people in the section being randomized as to where they go in 

### Scenario 2
People go in back to front efficiently

### TODO
